The main focus was on the management and optimization of images, videos, fonts and other assets intended for players, who take care of their display. In a second phase, I worked on the creation of a client for 'embedded' monitors - professional displays equipped with APIs and custom browsers, designed for digital signage applications. In addition to perfecting the product, I had the opportunity to participate in several projects, taking advantage of technologies such as Vue.js, React, Angular and developing mobile apps on Android (Kotlin)."
