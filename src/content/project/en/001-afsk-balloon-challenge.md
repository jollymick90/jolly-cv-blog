## TL;DR

My bachelor's project was an interdisciplinary challenge with an ambitious goal: sending a cube to 40,000 meters altitude.
We didn’t quite make it — but I learned a lot along the way.
Today, that project lives on as an educational game to teach radio communication and geostationary coordinates.
