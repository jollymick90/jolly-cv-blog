# **University – Information Engineering**  

**Period:** 2009 – 2015  
**University:** Università degli studi di Padova  

During my university studies, I developed skills in electronics, telecommunications, and computer science, building a broad and interdisciplinary technical foundation. My academic experience was defined by three key elements:  

- **Studies and training:** I deepened my understanding of topics related to information engineering, developing both a solid theoretical background and practical skills.  
- **Parallel work experience:** To finance my studies, I worked in a discount store, taking on various operational roles including cashier, stockroom management, inventory, and staff coordination. This helped me develop management and organizational skills, as well as enhance my problem-solving attitude and teamwork abilities.  
- **Thesis project:** I carried out an innovative project, developing a **payload for a stratospheric high-altitude balloon**. The payload, based on Arduino, included a custom-designed electronic circuit for signal transmission via **AFSK (Audio Frequency-Shift Keying)** radio modulation. I adapted and optimized an open-source project, working on both the hardware and software components, with the goal of testing long-distance communications. Although the launch was not completed due to bureaucratic issues, the project allowed me to apply my skills in electronics, telecommunications, and computer science in a practical setting, further strengthening my problem-solving and design capabilities.
