### 🌍 **Realtime Bus Tracking**

**📆 Period:** 2019
**🏢 Context:** Feature developed as part of a larger digital signage system in the public transport domain.
**🎯 Goal:**
Develop a mobile feature to track a bus in real-time during its route, display its current location on a map, and provide upcoming stop information to passengers.

**🧱 Architecture:**

* **Platform:** Android (native app)
* **Device:** Embedded minicomputer running Android OS with integrated GPS module
* **Data source:** GPS coordinates provided by proprietary onboard hardware
* **Key features:**

  * Download and management of predefined route tracks
  * Live map display of the current bus position
  * Visualization of upcoming bus stops along the route

**🚀 My Role:**

* Integrated with proprietary hardware to receive live GPS data
* Built the logic to download and render route tracks on the map
* Implemented real-time camera-follow behavior on the bus marker
* Created a route simulator to test the movement without live GPS input
* Managed the logic to display future stops dynamically

**💡 Key Challenges Solved:**

* Ensured smooth sync between GPS data and map navigation
* Built a movement simulator to test edge cases and improve UX
* Optimized performance for limited-resource embedded Android systems

**🧰 Technologies:**
`Android SDK` · `Google Maps / OpenStreetMap` · `Kotlin/Java` · `Custom GPS integration` · `JSON/REST`
