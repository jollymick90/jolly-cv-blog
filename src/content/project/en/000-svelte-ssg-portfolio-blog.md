## TL;DR

* I really wanted to build my own personal website
* I was learning Svelte and it felt like a complete solution for both my current and future needs
* The project took longer than expected
* I'm happy with the result and excited to keep improving it

## Let’s start from the beginning

At the start of this year, I decided to create *my website*.
A space of my own — a place to collect everything I am, everything I do, and how I grow.
Not just another social profile, and not something hosted on someone else’s platform.
I wanted something personal, something that would grow with me — line by line, commit after commit.

You might ask: “Why go through all that trouble?”
After all, I’m a web developer. I build websites, apps, CMSes, and blogs every day.
But *precisely because of that*, I felt it was time to build something for *myself*.
