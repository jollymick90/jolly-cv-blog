# First Experience: **Red-V**

## First Phase – Red-V

### **Software Engineer – Red-V (Rinnova Research)**

**Period:** 2015 – 2021
**Sector:** Digital Signage, Multimedia CMS

During this experience, I contributed to the development and evolution of a **full-stack Digital Signage product**, a CMS for managing and scheduling multimedia content on connected devices (players). I worked on various parts of the system, developing backend, frontend, and embedded software skills.

#### **Main Technologies Used:**

* **Backend:** Java (monolith with JSP), Hibernate, SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)
* **Frontend:** JavaScript, TypeScript, jQuery
* **Multimedia Processing:** FFmpeg, ImageMagick
* **Player:** Qt, Android (Java/Kotlin), Web (TypeScript, jQuery)

#### **Key Contributions and Projects:**

* **Web Player for Digital Signage**
  I designed and developed a web player from scratch for large-format screens, used on **standard browsers and Smart TVs (Toshiba, Samsung Tizen)**. The player was built without modern frontend frameworks, using **TypeScript and jQuery**, and presented a significant technical challenge in optimizing performance on embedded devices.

* **Android Player – Advanced Features**
  I helped implement advanced features for the **Android player**, improving multimedia content handling and optimizing performance on customized devices (Android mini PCs).

* **Customer Support and Technical Assistance**
  I provided direct technical support to Italian clients, solving both software and hardware issues and assisting with customized Digital Signage devices.

* **Key Projects That Shaped Me:**

  * **Technology Upgrade at the Olympic Stadium**: supported the upgrade of a **multicast streaming system for 800 seat-back monitors**.
  * **Map-based Public Transport Tracking System**: developed backend and Android features for real-time bus location tracking.
  * **LED Wall Content Synchronization**: contributed to Java features ensuring smooth synchronization of content across large screens.

This experience allowed me to grow in both **backend (Java, databases, multimedia management)** and **frontend (web apps and SPAs on embedded browsers)**, establishing a solid foundation in full-stack software development.

## Second Phase – Ennova-Research (2019–2021)

### **Software Engineer – Ennova-Research (Red-V’s Parent Company)**

**Period:** 2019 – 2021
**Sector:** Mobile Development, GIS, Web Applications

After solidifying my experience at **Red-V**, I was involved in several projects for **Ennova-Research** clients, expanding my skills in **mobile and web frontend development**. I worked on both **B2B and B2C** solutions and contributed to **GIS projects** for the public and primary sectors.

#### **Mobile Development (Android – Kotlin, Java)**

* **B2B experience:** developed an Android application for **parking payment systems**, installed on industrial tablets.
* **B2C experience:** contributed to the development of a **tourism information app** for end-users to access local content and services.
* **Deepened my Kotlin knowledge**, working on structured Android projects in business contexts.

#### **Frontend Development (Vue.js, GIS, OpenLayers)**

* **Developed interactive GIS portals**, using **Vue.js and OpenLayers** to visualize and monitor geographic data.
* **Worked on projects for the public and agricultural sectors**, building advanced interfaces for managing spatial information.
* **Customized and developed interactive maps**, enhancing UX for data consultation and analysis.

#### **Ongoing Support to Red-V**

* Continued to support and improve Red-V’s **Digital Signage product**, providing technical assistance and developing new features.
