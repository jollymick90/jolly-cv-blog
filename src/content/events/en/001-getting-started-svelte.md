# **Frontend Roadmap: Beginning Dilemma**

**Quando:** Venezia Novembre 2024
**Dove:** GDG Dev-Fest Venezia

## Description
This was description on my first talk on a tech conferences: GDG Dev Fest:

<i>Have you ever asked yourself which are the differences between Angular, React, Vue e Svelte? Which one should i choose to kick off my frontend career? Your friend Jack at the bar just told you about a brilliant idea. He asked you for a hand to build it, and you've just learned Angular at work: 
What a great opportunity to put your knowledge to work! 
But wait wait! Are you sure it wouldn't be better to do it in React? 
Is there any reason to try AlpineJS if I already feel confident with React? o no! I hadn’t even finished reading this abstract when I found out that Next exists, Vuex is a thing... and Angular jumped from version 18 to 22.

The Frontend world keeps changing. It can be hard to find the right path for yourself.
And it's also difficult to make a choice when you've become more senior - picking the right technologies for your client isn't always easy.

We’ll walk you through the main frontend technologies, clear up some common doubts, and help you understand when and why to choose each one.
