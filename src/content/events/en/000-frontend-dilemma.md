# **Frontend Roadmap: Beginning Dilemma**

**Quando:** Novembre 2024
**Dove:** GDG Dev-Fest Venezia

## Description
This was description on my first talk on a tech conferences: GDG Dev Fest:

<i>Have you ever asked yourself which are the differences between Angular, React, Vue e Svelte? Which one should i choose to kick off my frontend career? Your friend Jack at the bar just told you about a brilliant idea. He asked you for a hand to build it, and you've just learned Angular at work: 
What a great opportunity to put your knowledge to work! 
But wait wait! Are you sure it wouldn't be better to do it in React? 
Is there any reason to try AlpineJS if I already feel confident with React? o no! I hadn’t even finished reading this abstract when I found out that Next exists, Vuex is a thing... and Angular jumped from version 18 to 22.

The Frontend world keeps changing. It can be hard to find the right path for yourself.
And it's also difficult to make a choice when you've become more senior - picking the right technologies for your client isn't always easy.

We’ll walk you through the main frontend technologies, clear up some common doubts, and help you understand when and why to choose each one.
</i>

I want to thank the organizers for giving me the chance to give my first talk in front of a large audience.
Now, a few months later, I’d like to reflect on that experience and share some insights in this post.

I'm going to break points down into two parts:
those about the topic itself, and those about how it was presented.


# Frontend Dilemma

## Curiosity 

Curiosity, combined with how easily you can explore things in the browser, is what attracted me to frontend development.

It’s an attitude that probably applies to any area of computer science — or even to the entire scientific and technological field.
I still keep my head in the browser: compared to other areas like desktop or mobile app development, the result of a web application is easily “inspectable.”
All it takes is a right-click to open the inspector.


## Roadmap

[ROADMAP](https://roadmap.sh/)

Have you heard of this site? It shows a map of all the careers and paths you can take in tech.
Let’s reflect on a few points:

These paths are strongly connected to each other. You shouldn’t think of them as isolated or separate tracks.

You can change course. Just like with any GPS, if you feel like you’ve taken a wrong turn, it’s worth adjusting your route!

The map is not the territory. The steps shown here aren’t necessarily the ones you’ll encounter in real life. In fact, projects and companies will often push you to take a different path — or skip steps entirely.

## Pick a framework
[Frontend Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)

When you read the frontend roadmap on roadmap.sh, you’ll eventually reach the section called ‘Pick a framework’.

I started my career in 2015. At that time, there was a lot of buzz around frontend frameworks and libraries.
Personally, I wasn’t working with modern technologies yet — I was using JSP and jQuery.

I have to say, it was a great training ground. And later, working with Vue, Angular, and React in succession gave me the chance to see these tools grow and mature — just like I did.

So I asked myself: if I had to choose a framework today, which one would I pick?
And more importantly — how would I go about choosing it?


## Ingredients



To answer this question, I simply thought about what I usually do when trying out a new technology.

I explore the options available on the market

I compare the results

I try them out hands-on

From this process, I identified three key ingredients for choosing the right framework:

Having a clear overview of the available frameworks

Defining comparison criteria

Testing them directly
