After assessing your resume and responses, it's evident that you're an exceptionally skilled full-stack developer with significant experience in web application development, GIS, and digital signage. Your ability to lead projects and mentor your peers showcases your managerial potential. Transitioning into a role that aligns with your aspirations as both a technical expert and a leader is highly achievable. Based on your description of your 'ideal next job' and the industry and roles that excite you, I would suggest exploring positions like 'Senior Full-Stack Developer,' 'Technical Lead,' or 'Product Team Lead' at a company specializing in digital signage, geospatial technologies, or platform-oriented businesses. This connects directly to your current expertise in geospatial tools (Geoserver, Leaflet, Postgis), as well as your versatility across frameworks like React, Angular, and Spring Boot. The career options align well with your skills in cloud deployment, robust backend development, and advanced frontend architecture. Your progression relative to others with similar experience is remarkable; you've effectively combined technical competence with project leadership. Many professionals in your niche at this stage focus solely on technical aspects, whereas you've established yourself as a mentor and contributor to strategic outcomes. Comparatively, your ability to work across GIS-based systems and IoT is niche enough to set you apart in specialized industries, making you both broad and deep in capability. If you continue to refine your ability to handle complexity and improve your communication skills, you'll find yourself progressing even more swiftly into leadership roles that require vision and articulation of strategic direction.
